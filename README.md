The History App Report

We are in an era where there is now there is a plethora of advanced technology and more to come, it is important that people learn about history especially the youth of today so that they have knowledge people of the past era. Young students or young people in general will now be able to educate themselves by using this app which is called ‘The History App’. A very close family friend of mine whose name is Sarah is a dedicated history teacher who teaches at St Johns High School. She has kindly asked me to create the app for her Matric students to use to aid them with studying throughout their year. She said that she wishes for her students to have a fun and engaging experience throughout their Matric year, and she hopes that with this app they will be able to have that. This essay will discuss the overall goal of the app and all the work that was done for the app to be made and to be able to be fully functional and provide an engaging experience for the students. 

The purpose of this app is to educate young students on famous figures of the past whether it be a famous music artist, actor/actress, a sports athlete etc. The app is straightforward to use. All the user must do is put their age in the textbox and press the Generate button and at the bottom of the user’s screen a text which will provide information on a famous person. The persons whose information will appear will depend on what age the user in the textbox as it will match to the age that that the person passed away. This way, students may a bit of incite on people that may or may not have known of. The user may only enter ages ranging from 20-50 years. If any number beyond that range is entered, the user will be greeted with an error message prompting them to put a valid age. For the User Interface, there were two historic themed pictures used for the top and bottom half of the page. The Generate and Clear buttons of the app are coloured orange to have a close match with the pictures to give the app an overall historic feel. The text that is at the bottom of the screen when the user enters their age is in a bold black font which makes it clearly visible on top of the picture. In the screenshot below is what the UI of the app looks like and what appears when the user puts their age.

The development process of this app was started by designing the User Interface. I first started by searching for historic themed pictures to put on each of the screen. Once I found two suitable pictures, I started to get to work on designing the app by putting the pictures, adding the buttons, changing the colours etc and making sure everything was in the right position which only took about an hour to do. After doing that, it was time for the coding part. I started by declaring everything that needed to be declared such the Generate and Clear button, the pictures etc. After declaring everything that needed to be declared I activated the Generate and Clear buttons for them to do what they needed to do. Both buttons were activated using ‘setOnClicklistener’. However, before activating the Generate button, I needed to research famous people of the past in to write about them in the code. Once I found all the information that was needed, I put it all into the code. To activate the Generate button I used ‘If’ and ‘else’ statements. This way if the user typed the valid age the information of the specific person would show at the bottom of the screen. The screenshot below shows all everything that needed to be declared and the activated Generate and Clear buttons.

As mentioned before, if the user types an invalid age a message appears at the bottom of the screen prompting the user to enter a valid age. For that message to appear I just used the ‘else’ statement and typed the error message. The screenshot below shows how that error message is created.

Doing the code for this app was probably one of the hardest parts because it took quite some time to write it all out especially for the Generate Button because I must type out the ‘If’ and ‘Else’ statements over and over with the different people and writing about them in the statements. 
 
After I had finished making the app, it was time test it out see if it would run. The first time I ran the app I ran without the ‘Else’ statement for the error message, and it ran just without any issues. Both the Generate and Clear button worked perfectly. However, the problem came when I added the code for the error message to display at the bottom of the screen. Whenever I would try running the app sometimes the emulator would just show a loading message for a long time without finishing and sometimes if it did it would just show an error saying, ‘could not load emulator.’ Sometimes the emulator would eventually load but then it would just show a black screen with nothing in it. I then removed the code to if that would do anything and it did as the emulator worked normally with no issues. I tried finding out what the issue could’ve possibly not to load but I couldn’t. So out curiosity I added the code again, but I only changed one thing which was the error message. Surprisingly when I ran the emulator this time it worked. It took a bit of time, but it loaded, and I also tested if the error message would work, and it did without any issues. This is a screenshot to show what happens when the user types a number beyond the age limit.

As I continue to learn more about programming, the process of developing this app has taught me that a still have a lot to learn about programming which really look forward to. It was such a great experience exploring the world of Kotlin and playing around with all its features and doing research on the people that I was going to write about in the code as I didn’t know everyone that I wrote about, so it was interesting.  If I had more time to, I would figure out what I could do to maybe improve the design of the app, like maybe putting pictures of the person who information appears next to text, maybe I could’ve increased the age limit just to give a bit more variety or maybe I could’ve add made a more brownish colour in the middle of the page to match with the background pictures. Overall, I am very happy with how this app has turned out and I really look forward to showing visible improvement in all my future app projects.

In conclusion, I hope that The History App will be able to offer a very interactive and engaging experience for the students as they will be able to about famous figures of the past. I hope they will be able to take advantage of easy access of this as it will aid for their studies which is one of the of this app.
